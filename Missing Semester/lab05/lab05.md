# Lab05 Solution

## Mission Control
1. The command parameters given by the solution are incorrect.
   After my test, the command "pkill -Af sleep" can run normally,
   but the command given by the solution will prompt "Invalid parameter -a"
2. sleep 60 &
   pgrep sleep | wait && ls

## NickName
1. alias dc=cd
2. The running results have been saved locally

## Config
1. already configured locally
2. See my "dotfile" project on github

## Remote Device
I don't have a remote Linux or virtual machine,
but I have used these commands on my VPS,
so I won't post the commands and results here
