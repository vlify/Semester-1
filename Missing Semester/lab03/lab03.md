# Lab03-Solusion

Well, to be honest, my vim was already set up before taking this course.
I don't want to mess up my vim configuration, so I plan to skip this lab. 
If someone who visit my github still want the vim configuration given in the course, I've posted it in lab03.

By the way,I don`t really like the method of installing plugins for vim given in the course.
It look really old and unintalligent
I recommend using vim-plug, which is what I use myself. It's really convenient.
Specifically,you can refer to this blog:

Finaly,please stick with vim,it`s a very funny journey.
